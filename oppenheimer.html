                <h2>Review</h2>
                <p>Christopher Nolan's "Oppenheimer" is a masterful biographical thriller that chronicles the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist known as the "father of the atomic bomb." The film presents a complex portrait of a brilliant mind grappling with the moral implications of creating history's most destructive weapon.</p>
                
                <p>Cillian Murphy delivers a career-defining performance as Oppenheimer, capturing both the intellectual brilliance and the mounting psychological toll of his creation. The supporting cast, including Emily Blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer and Robert Downey Jr. as Lewis Strauss, provides exceptional depth to this historical drama.</p>

                <h2>Technical Aspects</h2>
                <p>Shot entirely in IMAX format, the film's cinematography by Hoyte van Hoytema is stunning, particularly during the Trinity test sequence. The use of practical effects over CGI adds a tangible reality to the atomic explosions. Ludwig Göransson's score perfectly complements the mounting tension throughout the film.</p>
                
                <p>Nolan's decision to shoot in black and white for certain timeline sequences helps viewers navigate the complex narrative structure, while the color sequences provide vivid immediacy to the Los Alamos portions of the story.</p>

                <h2>Verdict</h2>
                <p>Oppenheimer is a towering achievement in filmmaking that succeeds both as a character study and as a historical epic. It's a thought-provoking examination of scientific responsibility, moral compromise, and the weight of world-changing decisions. The film's technical excellence, combined with outstanding performances and Nolan's masterful direction, makes it a must-watch for serious cinema enthusiasts.</p>
